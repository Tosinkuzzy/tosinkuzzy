# 👋 Hi, I'm Tosin Ayomide Adeleye

**Software Engineer | Backend Developer | Technical Product Manager**

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a passionate and performance-driven software engineer, building scalable, high-availability backend solutions and exploring DevOps, scripting, and open source.

## 💼 About Me

I'm a seasoned backend developer with over **2 years** of experience architecting APIs and microservices with **Node.js, Python, SQL**, and Linux systems. 
I’ve designed production-level systems that handle **10K+ daily requests** with a **99.9% uptime guarantee**.

🔧 As a Product Manager, I led a team to launch a real-time analytics dashboard that increased decision-making speed by 40%, reduced deployment time by 50%, and cut bugs by 25%, thanks to CI/CD and thorough testing.

📚 I’m an ALX SE Foundations and Professional graduate, Microsoft Learn and LinkedIn certified in Software Engineering, and active in global learning circles and tech communities.
